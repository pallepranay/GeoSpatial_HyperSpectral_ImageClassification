# GeoSpatial_HyperSpectral_ImageClassification
This is the research project of GeoSpatial Hyperspectral Image Classification


Unlike traditional RGB images, which only capture three bands of color (red, green, and blue), hyperspectral data can capture hundreds or even thousands of narrow and contiguous bands that cover a much wider range of the electromagnetic spectrum.

Hyperspectral Imaging collects hundreds of channels at different wavelengths for the same spatial area. Each channel covers a certain range of wavelength of light reflected by the surface that is imaged. 

The collected data form a so-called hyperspectral cube, in which two dimensions represent the spatial extent of the scene and the third its spectral content. HSI has variety of applications, including remote sensing, environmental monitoring, mineral exploration, to map minerals in rocks and medical imaging in the field of computer vision
